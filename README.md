React State Management:
Could be used to handle user interactions like the "Not Interested" button.
React Router (if navigation is involved for "Read More").
Styling:

CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS:
The clean layout and highlighted heading suggest the use of utility-first frameworks like Tailwind or custom CSS classes.

Backend or APIs (if included):

May connect to an API to fetch destination details dynamically.
JSON or RESTful API for data handling.
